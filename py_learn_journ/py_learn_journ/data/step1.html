        <section>I was out for illness again today, but spent the day learning more about Pyramid. Pyramid is a tool that provides a great many tools for web development with Python and other languages. Today I started the Expense Tracker app, as provide by CodeFellows. With the addition of the cookiecutter package, I built a scaffold, providing a number of directories and files pre-loaded with all kinds of dependencies and starter code. We used pip install and setuptools, as well as a module that allows pyramid to interact with ipython (pyramid_ipython). The tutorial had us first write a super simplified "Hello World!" app to test the tools. I then deleted that and  started messing around with the expense tracker. 
        I walked through the steps to modify some of the files. Need to spend a lot more time with this, and probably draw myself a few flowcharts to really grasp how the files all interact with one another.
